# plasmon-analysis
A python script taking data from a linear CCD array (from oberserving light from metal films due to surface plasmon resonance) and fitting it to curves to obtain critical angle, resonance angle, etc. The curve used is Sigmoid-Asymmetric curve [1]. An exmaple plot can be seen in Figure 1. Also included is some example data in the data directory. Used as a part of my third year undergraduate project on surface plasmon resonance.

Figure 1. Example of a reflectance plot generated by the script. This was for a gold film of around 50nm thickness
