# plasmon-analysis
A python script taking data from a linear CCD array (from oberserving light from metal films due to surface plasmon resonance) and fitting it to curves to obtain critical angle, resonance angle, etc. Used as a part of my third year undergraduate project on surface plasmon resonance. Also included is some example data in the data directory
